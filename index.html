            <h3 class="uppercase">Student Experience</h3>
            <p> During my time as a student I have been able to develop the way 
                I learn and interact with others
                to a degree that has also helped me to mature into a better person
                I have come to believe that this maturity will help me to develop into a better thinker as well, 
                one that has the patience to listen and take consideration of what others have to say
